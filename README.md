## Author ##

The software is primarily developed and maintained by Fabian Jankowski. For more information, feel free to contact me via: fabian.jankowski at cnrs-orleans.fr.

## Installation ##

The easiest and recommended way to install the software is via the Python command `pip` directly from the `searchtools` GitHub software repository. For instance, to install the master branch of the code, use the following command:  
`pip install git+https://github.com/fjankowsk/searchtools.git@master`

This will automatically install all dependencies. Depending on your Python installation, you might want to replace `pip` with `pip3` in the above command.
